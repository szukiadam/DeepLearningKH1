**Homework no. 4**

To get the images I used a command from this article : https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-easily-download-googles-open-images-dataset-for-your-ai-apps-db552a82fc6

The logs are in the zip files, where "log" is the log file for the training with the base layers frozen, whereas "logs2" is for the training with some other layers included as well. 

I used google colab since my computer was having a hard time dealing with this many images.
